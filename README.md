# zkFold x zkPass: Bring zkPass to Cardano

**zkPass** on Cardano is a smart contract that enables developers to post, verify, and utilize zkPass oracle attestations on the Cardano blockchain. It is a tool that makes new types of DApps possible on Cardano.

This repository contains code to construct transactions for the zkPass smart contract.  (Relevant executables are described [here](https://github.com/zkFold/zkpass-cardano/blob/main/backends/README.md).)
